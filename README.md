# weekly-fafsa

Step 1: Download weekly FAFSA report

Notes: Make sure file names are in the format "`state'(1)" (may download as "`state'(N)" which you'll need to manually change)
Notes: Files supposed to be updated on Fridays; often not until the afternoon and sometimes not until Mondays
Notes: File sheet names change when the calendar year changes; code for import reflects this difference

Step 2: Update master do.file with new week & add additional lines in the import, clean, and weekly graph files

Step 3: Run code.
